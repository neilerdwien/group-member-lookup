# Group Member Lookup

This is a gadget that displays members of a group on [OmniUpdate's OU Campus content management system](https://omniupdate.com/) in a more convenient way for use in email.

OU Campus' built-in facilities can display group membership, but this gadget has additional capabilities:

# Display members in a text/HTML format that can be copied and pasted into an email message.
# Include a membership list in pre-composed messages in OU Campus' messaging system.

## Installation
TBD

## History
